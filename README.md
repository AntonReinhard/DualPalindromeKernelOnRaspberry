# DualPalindromeKernelOnRaspberry
This is a repository where I keep my kernels for the RaspberryPi Zero W. Eventually I want it to be able to run 24/7 and calculate more numbers of the series http://oeis.org/A060792

I got the GPIO functions and the makefile from:
http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/os/ok03.html

and the firmware from:
https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/tree/master/boot
